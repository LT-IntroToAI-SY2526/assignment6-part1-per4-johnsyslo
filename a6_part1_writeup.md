## Part 1: Understanding Your Model

### Question 1: R² Score Interpretation
What does the R² score tell you about your model? What does it mean if R² is close to 1? What if it's close to 0?

**YOUR ANSWER:**




---

### Question 2: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
What does the MSE (Mean Squared Error) mean in plain English? Why do you think we square the errors instead of just taking the average of the errors?

**YOUR ANSWER:**




---

### Question 3: Model Reliability
Would you trust this model to predict a score for a student who studied 10 hours? Why or why not? Consider:
- What's the maximum hours in your dataset?
- What happens when you make predictions outside the range of your training data?

**YOUR ANSWER:**




---

## Part 2: Data Analysis

### Question 4: Relationship Description
Looking at your scatter plot, describe the relationship between hours studied and test scores. Is it:
- Strong or weak?
- Linear or non-linear?
- Positive or negative?

**YOUR ANSWER:**




---

### Question 5: Real-World Limitations
What are some real-world factors that could affect test scores that this model doesn't account for? List at least 3 factors.

**YOUR ANSWER:**
1. 
2. 
3.

## Part 3: Code Reflection

### Question 6: Train/Test Split
Why do we split our data into training and testing sets? What would happen if we trained and tested on the same data?

**YOUR ANSWER:**

## Optional: Extra Credit (+2 points)

If you want to challenge yourself, modify your code to:
1. Try different train/test split ratios (60/40, 70/30, 90/10)
2. Record the R² score for each split
3. Explain below which split ratio worked best and why you think that is
